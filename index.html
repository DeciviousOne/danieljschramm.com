										<h3>Return Portal</h3>
									</div>
									<p>Led a team in designing and building a customer facing return portal to replace the old labour and paperwork intensive system. The build process involved directing multiple cross functional teams to get information about the existing process and design new processes optimized for an online first portal. Afterwards, we visited customers for testing and refining.</p>
									<p>The final product resulted in increased customer satisfaction, 75% reduction in time between returns and credits, 0 internal paper usage, complete elimination of returns missing required information, and an up to 95% reduction of labour required.</p>
									<p>The portal was simplistic and auto-populated as much information as possible from customers previous sales so the return process was as easy as possible and customers were happy to use it. It also included tracking, management, and permission functionality. Written in C# using Blazor.</p>

										<h3>Online Trade show</h3>
									</div>
									<p>Led a cross-functional team in bringing our annual trade show online to replace our slow and labour intensive book based trade show. The design process was about finding the most intuitive system for use on an in-person tablet based trade show. A digitized trade book with clickable divs for adding products to cart was selected.</p>
									<p>The released product worked perfectly on tablets as well as desktops and phones. The intuitive online trade show had a 250% increase in customers who bought from the trade show. A 95% reduction in order delivery time due to orders being placed immediately instead of being recorded in a book. </p>
									<p>Customers were also able to use online benefits like barcode scanners, online PDFs, and online raffle tickets. Written in C# ASP.Net and later upgraded to Blazor 8.0</p>

										<h3>RFID Inventory Tracking</h3>
									</div>
									<p>To improve asset management, I tested and implemented an RFID inventory tracking system for IT equipment such as laptops, handheld scanners, and other hardware. Each asset was tagged with RFID chips, and mounted RFID scanners automatically logged movement and stock levels. The backend system was built in C#, while Python was used to generate RFID tags.</p>
									<p>The solution transformed how audits were performed. Quarterly audits were reduced by 98% in time spent, since staff only needed to locate missing products rather than manually check every item. Annual audits remain in place as a safeguard, but the overall burden of asset management dropped dramatically.</p>
									<p>In addition to efficiency gains, the system provides real-time visibility into stock levels, with automatic email alerts when supplies run low. Handheld scanners can also be used to locate individual tagged items, making it easy to find misplaced equipment quickly.</p>

										<h3>Liner Scheduler</h3>
									</div>
									<p>As the sole developer I was tasked with solving a costly production bottleneck. The company sold 10+ styles of pool liners but only one could be in the cutting machine at a time. If an order came up that was a different type than what was currently loaded the spool had to be switched to the new style. Switching could take up to 10 minutes, leaving employees idle and significantly slowing production.</p>
									<p>Due to deadline constraints orders were typically loaded up in the order they came in, which frequently led to liner A being in, swapping to liner B and then back to A. In many cases, the time spent swapping liners was as long as cutting an actual order.</p>
									<p>To address this, I designed and built a scheduling application that optimized production sequencing. The system ensured that no liner was late while minimizing machine changeovers, reducing swaps by at least 50%. This not only freed up substantial operator time but also allowed the company to cut more liners in the same period, improving throughput and meeting delivery deadlines more efficiently.</p>
