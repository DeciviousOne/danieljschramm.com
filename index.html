									<h3>Return Portal</h3>
									<p>Led a team in designing and building a customer facing return portal to replace the old labour and paperwork intensive system. The build process involved directing mutiple cross functional teams to get information about the existing process and design new processes optimized for an online first portal. Afterwards, we visited customers for testing and refining.</p>
									<p>The final product resulted in increased customer satisfaction, 75% reduction in time between returns and credits, 0 internal paper usage, complete elimination of returns missing required information, and an up to 95% reduction of labour required.</p>
									<p>The portal was simplistic and auto-populated as much information as possible from customers previous sales so the return process was as easy as possible and customers were happy to use it. It also included tracking, management, and permission functionality. Written in C# using Blazor.</p>
